# Understanding How Money Is a Universal Religion

## Chapter 1: Introduction

Welcome to the world of money - a place where power, influence, and status reign supreme. Money is more than just a medium of exchange; it is a symbol of power and control that shapes the destiny of nations and individuals alike. Many of us live our lives worshipping the Almighty Dollar, without ever stopping to question the impact it has on our lives.

In this chapter, we'll explore the idea of money as a universal religion and delve into its origins and evolution over time. We're honoured to have Yuval Noah Harari, the renowned historian and author of *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind*, as a special guest to shed some light on this topic. 

According to Harari, "Money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised." Money is a shared belief system that connects people across the globe and allows us to cooperate on a scale that was once unthinkable. The power of money lies not in the coins and bills that we carry in our pockets but in the shared belief that these pieces of paper and metal have value.

As we dive deeper into the concept of money as a universal religion, we'll explore the psychological and emotional factors that make money such a potent force. We'll examine the impact of modern technology on our relationship with money and discuss the implications of this for the future. 

So let's strap on our thinking caps and explore this fascinating topic together. By the end of this chapter, you'll have gained a deeper understanding of the role that money plays in our lives and the world around us.
