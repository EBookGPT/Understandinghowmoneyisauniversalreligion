# Chapter 6: The Impact of Globalization on Money as a Universal Religion

Welcome to the sixth chapter of our journey of Understanding how money is a universal religion. In this chapter, we are going to examine the significant impact of globalization on the concept of money as a universal religion.

Globalization has brought drastic changes to the economic landscape of the world, leading to an increase in cross-border trade and investment. As a result, the global economy has grown, and the financial markets have become more integrated. With the growth of the global economy, the power dynamics of money and its influence on people's lives have significantly shifted.

In this chapter, we are going to discuss how globalization has affected the concept of money as a universal religion. We will explore the increased importance of financial institutions such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and central banks in shaping the global economy. We'll also examine how the growing influence of multinational corporations and the use of international currencies like the US dollar and the Euro have contributed to the hegemony of the financial elite in the world.

We will also discuss the effects of globalization on the distribution of wealth worldwide. The neoliberal policies of the past decades have led to an increase in income inequality within and among countries and have thus challenged the idea of money as a means of exchange among equals.

But there are also encouraging developments. The rise of digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others has the potential to change the way we view and use money. We will explore how these currencies can challenge the established monetary system and offer new opportunities for individuals and businesses worldwide.

So, get ready to delve into the fascinating and complex impact of globalization on money as a universal religion. The journey starts now!
